description: Musings. Music. Modern-Day Heiroglyphs.
---

Why do most repos / projects start with <span style="color: red">_First commit._</span>? If this answer doesn't find me, Ill never know. Because it is highly unlikely I will ever look it up.

Either way it felt fitting for the title of my first blog postðŸ¤“. In building my own personal soapbox, its  only fair to outline what you can expect when stopping by.  There are three main categories I will tag each post with:

### Musings 
Where I pick a random topic and expand on it as best I can, backed by a little research of course.

### Music
A deep dive on something related to music. It may be an artist I draw inspiration from in one way or another. Or something cool I need to share as I study music theory.

### Modern-Day Heiroglyphs
Let's say the world ended tomorrow. Now let's fast-forward and some future civilization happened a "#{tech_company}"'s conference room... How different would the code on the whiteboards at Amazon be to this hypothetical civilization, than that of the Egyptian writings on the wall to us?  Anywho, Modern-Day Heiroglyphs relates to me writing about codeðŸ˜Š 

I hope you enjoy; I hope you reach out to connect! At the very least, I hope my sharings help in some way. Until next timeðŸ¤“!
