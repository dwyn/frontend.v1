Hello Neighbor. I will add lovely little gems that I find to aide in productivity in Rails development. For now, these are the gems I feel are worth endorsing. 

## Better Errors (friggin LOVING this gem!)

Better Errors replaces the standard Rails error page with a much better and more useful error page. It is also usable outside of Rails in any Rack app as Rack middleware.

## Rpsec for Rails (Because, tests.)

## Active Admin

byebug has a very similar interface as gdb, but byebug does not use the powerful Pry REPL.
