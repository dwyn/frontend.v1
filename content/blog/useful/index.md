description: Tidbits I looovvee!
---

Hello neighbor. I must say, I am really excited about having one place to store all of the things I want to share with the world. I share a little on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dwyn/); a little on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dwyn); I have [a few gists](https://gist.github.com/dwyn) with useful information; I have a few [repos](https://github.com/dwyn) with useful code. But [dwayne.fm](https://dwayne.fm) has been / will be great for keeping things in one place and organizedðŸ˜Š

Anywho, these are some useful tidbits that I've found helpful in my journey to transhumanism... I mean becoming a stellar engineer. Feel free to use what you like, give me feedback on what you hate and most certainly share what you love! As always Ill continue to update as neccessary.

# <span id="vscode">VSCode Extentions</span>


[Babel JavaScript](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgmcdermott.vscode-language-babel)</span><br>
JavaScript syntax highlighting for ES201x, React JSX, Flow and GraphQL. Fairly useful, I feel.


[Better comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments)<br>
The Better Comments extension will help you create more human-friendly comments in your code. I enjoy this extension.


[Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer)<br>
This extension allows matching brackets to be identified with colours. The user can define which characters to match, and which colours to use. I don't love using curly braces for everything. Colorcoding them helps a bit. (If for nothing else, helps with prettiness)


[Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)<br>
A basic spell checker that works well with camelCase code. The goal of this spell checker is to help catch common spelling errors while keeping the number of false positives low. This can be a bit of an annoyance because it will highlight words you intentionally misspell. Otherwise, its definitely useful.


[Custom Window Zoom](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=craigb85.custom-window-zoom)<br>
This Visual Studio Code extension allows you to set the zoom level increment/decrement level. By default VSCode increments/decrements by '1' which equates to ~20%. I feel so nerdy suggesting this, but 100% to 120% is a huge jump visually.


[Endwise](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kaiwood.endwise) (_Huge_ thanks to [Meg Gutshall](https://github.com/meg-gutshall) for this one ðŸ˜Š)<br>
Wisely add "end" in Ruby. If you are just starting out with Ruby, this will definitely help you. 


[GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)<br>
GitLens supercharges the Git capabilities built into Visual Studio Code. It helps you to visualize code authorship at a glance via Git blame annotations and code lens, seamlessly navigate and explore Git repositories, gain valuable insights via powerful comparison commands, and so much more. Super useful.


[IntelliCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode)<br>
The Visual Studio IntelliCode extension provides AI-assisted development features for Python, TypeScript/JavaScript and Java developers in Visual Studio Code, with insights based on understanding your code context combined with machine learning. For me this was useful with JavaScript, and thats about it.


[JavaScript (ES6) code snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xabikos.JavaScriptSnippets)<br>
This extension contains code snippets for JavaScript in ES6 syntax for Vs Code editor (supports both JavaScript and TypeScript). Useful.


[Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync)<br>
Synchronize Settings, Snippets, Themes, File Icons, Launch, Keybindings, Workspaces and Extensions Across Multiple Machines Using GitHub Gist. I mean... come on!!! This is awesome.

# <span id="macos">macOS Apps</span>

[Alfred3](https://www.alfredapp.com/)<br>
Alfred is an award-winning app for macOS which boosts your efficiency with hotkeys, keywords, text expansion and more. Search your Mac and the web, and be more productive with custom actions to control your Mac. Use this. End of dicussion.


[Amphetamine](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12)<br>
Amphetamine can keep your Mac, and optionally its display, awake through a super simple on/off switch, or automatically through easy-to-configure Triggers


[AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/)<br>
AppCleaner is a small application which allows you to thoroughly uninstall unwanted apps. macOS MVP. One of the most reliable and useful apps I've used on macOS in forever.

[Bartender3](https://www.macbartender.com)<br>
Bartender 3 lets you organize your menu bar icons, by hiding them, rearranging them, show hidden items with a click or keyboard shortcut and have icons show when they update. I love this app, and others like it.<br>

(A free alternative to Bartender is [Dozer](https://dozermac.com). But I have never used it; proceed with caution. Do let me know what you think.)

[Boom3D](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/boom3d-volume-booster-and-eq/id1233048948?mt=12)<br>
The Best System-wide Volume Booster with 3D Surround Sound. Boom is just a great sound manager, through and through.


[Be Focused Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/be-focused-pro-focus-timer/id961632517?mt=12)<br>
The Be Focused lets you get things done by breaking up individual tasks among discrete intervals, separated by short breaks. [Pomodoro Technique anyone!?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

[Cheat Sheet](https://www.mediaatelier.com/CheatSheet/)<br>
Just hold the âŒ˜-Key a bit longer to get a list of all active short cuts of the current application. It's as simple as that. So useful - The cheatsheet will change depending on what app you hold âŒ˜ in! It's wonderful. 


[CopyClip2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/copyclip-2-clipboard-manager/id1020812363?mt=12)<br>
CopyClip 2 is the slickest and most efficient premium clipboard manager for your Mac. If you use Alfred, there isn't a need for CopyClip2. But its a solid app.


[Little Snitch 4](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html) (Thanks for the reminder, James Borocz!!!ðŸ¤“)<br>
As soon as youâ€™re connected to the Internet, applications can potentially send whatever they want to wherever they want. Most often they do this to your benefit. But sometimes, like in case of tracking software, trojans or other malware, they donâ€™t.
But you donâ€™t notice anything, because all of this happens invisibly under the hood. 10 / 10 WOULD RECOMMEND!!!


[Magnet](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12)<br>
Every time you move a content from one app to the other, compare data side by side or multitask in any other way, you need all the windows arranged accordingly. Magnet makes this process clean and simple. Window's OS does this natively. But its one of my favorite apps for macOS.


[Quiver](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quiver-take-better-notes/id866773894?mt=12)<br>
Quiver is a notebook built for programmers. It lets you easily mix text, code, Markdown and LaTeX within one note, edit code with an awesome code editor, live preview Markdown and LaTeX, and find any note instantly via the full-text search. I dont use this as much as I used to, but its a great app.


[SpotMenu](https://github.com/kmikiy/SpotMenu)<br>
Spotify and iTunes in your menu bar. Because music, and everything relating to it, is important.

### Reading
 1. I absolutely love [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/).
 
 2. ...and, believe it or not, the [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) is very well written!

### Viewing
For Javascript I absolutely love MPJ, Pluralsight and The Coding Train.

1. [M.P.J.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q)

2. [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw)

3. [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/)<br>
Pluralsight is one of my favorites in general, regardless of what language or framework / library you want to learn. Definitely check them out. I would even argue its worth the $30 - $40 investment for a couple months!


For Ruby (on Rails)(Thanks again, James Borocz)<br>
1. [Ruby on Rails Search Kit](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ruby-on-rails-search-kit/mbffhkcblmeaokcipfiockenaijcoikg?hl=en-US)<br>
This is specifically a Google Chrome extension. I'm into it.
